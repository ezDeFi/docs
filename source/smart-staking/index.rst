Smart Staking is a program that allows Nexty users to lock NTY within a certain time period and receive NTY in proportion to the bonus percentage at the end of the staking period. Specifically, Smart Staking is similar a bank savings online program, but there is a difference between Smart Staking and bankâ€™s savings programs. Smart Staking has an available pool, which pays interest and not bring money to invest as other conventional banking system, so Smart Staking is considered a deposit program is safe and lucrative.

Smart Staking has the following packages: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days. The bonus percentage of each package is set, and only admin is able to change interest rates. Normally, each time we change the bonus we will send a prior notice to the community and the percentage of this new bonus applies only to the depositors after the change period. The applied old bonus percentage will still be kept. The bonus amount specified in Smart Staking is the total bonus of a package. During the first 7 days, the deposit in Smart Staking cannot be withdrawn; starting from the 8th day, the amount could be withdrawn is corresponding to the bonus amount received per day. If you do not make a withdrawal every day, the interest will be accumulated until the "maturity date", the user will be allowed to withdraw both the original deposit and interest.
