For Merchants
==============================================================================================

How can I track my payment through ezDeFi?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ezDeFi doesn't keep any information regarding customer and merchant balance, and all the transaction are facilitated through the blockchain in which the cryptocurrency is being used.

Please refer to the explorer of that blockchain.

E.g: 
Track BTC payment through `<https://btc.com/>`_

Track ETH payment through `<https://etherscan.io/>`_

Track NewSD, NTY, and NTF payment through `<https://explorer.nexty.io/>`_

Your question is still not answered?
