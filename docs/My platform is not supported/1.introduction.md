<!-- theme: warning -->
> **Warning:**
> * On the client side, you should take an action to determine whether the order has been paid or not to notify the client (you can use the socket or call the server continuously to check)
> * Once payment is paid successfully, the gateway will call your `CALLBACK_URL` as mentioned above. Then, you should check the accuracy of the payment, avoid malicious codes calling the callback.

* Call the API (where `paymentid` is the parameter the gateway passes when calling the callback) to check if the payment is actually paid.

  "url": "api_url + `/payment/get?paymentid=${paymentid}`"
}

<!-- theme: info -->

> ezDeFi Gateway currently supports 2 payment methods:
>
> - Pay with ezDeFi Wallet
>
> - Pay with any crypto wallet based on `amountId` (amount is the amount the user has to pay for the order, the gateway will calculate and return `amountId` only and is close to the value of the order, which is approximately 0)

- In case the user uses any wallet method to pay, there may be cases where the user sends the wrong `amountId`, so we will check for such cases and send an exception to your website. 

To do so let us know the url of the exception you handled by calling the following API:

<!--
type: tab
title: JSON 
-->

```javascript
{
  "method": "put",
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/website/update_callback",
  "headers": {
    "callback": "{CALLBACK}",
    "websiteId": "{WEBSITE_ID}"
  }
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: HTTP Request 
-->

```json http
{
  "method": "put",
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/website/update_callback",
  "headers": {
    "callback": "{CALLBACK}",
    "websiteId": "{WEBSITE_ID}"
  }
}
```
<!-- type: tab-end-->

#### Other APIs

- Convert the value of the order into cryptocurrencies where `amount` is the price of the order, `originCurrency` is the currency currently applied on your website (e.g. USD), `symbols` are coins that You want to convert (e.g. 'btc, eth, nty')

<!--
type: tab
title: JSON 
-->

```javascript
{
  "method": "get", 
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/token/exchanges?amount=${amount} & from=${originCurrency} & to=${symbols}"
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: HTTP Request 
-->

```json http
{
  "method": "get", 
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/token/exchanges?amount=${amount} & from=${originCurrency} & to=${symbols}"
}
```
<!-- type: tab-end-->

- Taking the information of a transaction as mentioned earlier, when the user enters `amountId` mistakenly, the gateway will call the callback you saved earlier with the parameter `id`.

<!--
type: tab
title: JSON 
-->

```javascript
{
  "method": "get", 
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/transaction/get?id=${id}"
}
```

<!--
type: tab
title: HTTP Request 
-->

```json http
{
  "method": "get", 
  "url": "https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api/transaction/get?id=${id}"
}
```
<!-- type: tab-end-->

- Use this API to verify the accuracy of the transaction, to prevent hackers from taking advantage.
