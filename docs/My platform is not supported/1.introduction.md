# Before Getting Further

* Sign-up ezDeFi merchant account at [ezDeFi Merchant](https://merchant.ezdefi.com)

* Visit **Sites management** to create Site, then select the coin type to accept payments there. Please configure and save api key, siteid and gateway api url (https://merchant-api.ezdefi.com/api) in your config page for reuse later.

# Methods

#### Communication with `api_url`

Set `header` of `http/https request` to `apikey: YOUR_API_KEY`

#### Get configured data from merchant with API

    {method: get, url: api_url + '/website/:siteId'} 

From there, show the user the configured coins

#### Create Payment

* Call API and specify the parameters you have configured on the merchant with `coin_id` that the user have chosen
    
      {method: get, url: api_url + '/website/:siteId'}
    
* Call API to get the exchange rate of  `(origin currency: cryptocurrency)`

      {method: get, url: api_url + '/token/exchange/USD:BTC}

- After you have created the payment on the gateway, please display the order along with the QR code from the API returned and show it to the paying user.

      {method: get, url: api_url + '/payment/create', params: 
        { 'uoid' => "orderid-flag" (with flag = 1 if using anywallet method, flag = 0 if paying with ezdefi wallet),
          'amountId' => true|false  (true: if using anywallet method, false: if making payment by ezdefi wallet) (*)
          'coinId'   => coinId (coin_id that the user has chosen),
          'value'    => value (If this payment uses anywallet method, please send the coin amount of this order (BTC|ETH|TRX|...), if the payment uses ezdefiwallet, you only need to send the order amount (USD|VND|..)),
          'to' => walletAddress (the receiving wallet address on merchant.ezdefi.com),
          'currency' => base_currency:cryptocurrency (e.g. USD:BTC) (if it is anywallet method then please send it cryptocurrency:cryptocurrency e.g. BTC:BTC),
          'safedist' => safedist (block confirmation) value saved on merchant.ezdefi.com,
          'duration' => duration (duration value saved on merchant, convert this value to seconds),
          'callback' => callback url (when the payment is paid, call this url so you can know whether the order has been successfully paid or not, please process the order in that url)
        } 
      }

* On the client side, you should take an action to determine whether the order has been paid or not to notify the client (you can use the socket or call the server continuously to check)

* Once payment is paid successfully, the gateway will call your callback url as mentioned above. Then, you should check the accuracy of the payment, avoid malicious codes calling the callback.

* Call the API (where `paymentid` is the parameter the gateway passes when calling the callback) to check if the payment is actually paid.

      {method: get, url: api_url + `/payment/get?paymentid=${paymentid}`}

> ezDeFi Gateway currently supports 2 payment methods:
>
> * Pay with ezDeFi Wallet
>
> * Pay with any crypto wallet based on `amount_id` (amount is the amount the user has to pay for the order, the gateway will calculate and return `amount_id` only and is close to the value of the order, which is approximately 0)

* In case the user uses any wallet method to pay, there may be cases where the user sends the wrong `amount_id`

So we will check for such cases and send an exception to your website. To do so let us know the url of the exception you handled by calling the following API:

    {method: put, url: api_url + "/website/update_callback", params: {callback, websiteId}}

#### Other APIs

* Convert the value of the order into cryptocurrencies where `amount` is the price of the order, `originCurrency` is the currency currently applied on your website (e.g. USD), `symbols` are coins that You want to convert (e.g. 'btc, eth, nty')

      {method: get, url: `/token/exchanges?amount=${amount}&from=${originCurrency}&to=${symbols}`}

* Taking the information of a transaction as mentioned earlier, when the user enters `amount_id` mistakenly, the gateway will call the callback you saved earlier with the parameter` id`.

      {method: get, url: `/transaction/get?id=${id}`}

* Use this API to verify the accuracy of the transaction, to prevent hackers from taking advantage.
