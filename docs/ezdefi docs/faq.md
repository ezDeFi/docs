### General Questions
#### What is EzDeFi? How does it work? Where does the cryptocurrency I’m sending go?
EzDeFi is a platform that helps merchants anywhere in the world accept cryptocurrency payments in a fully decentralized way.

**How this works**

* When you want to pay a merchant, we will display instructions on how to send funds directly to this merchant, and monitor the blockchain for your transaction.

* After a valid payment is detected, we will notify the merchant so they can take any necessary actions on their end.

All payments facilitated by ezDeFi are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the cryptocurrency goes directly from your wallet to a wallet that is only accessible by the merchant. At no point in this flow does anyone except the merchant, including ezDeFi, have access to these funds.

How do I go about getting a refund? Can ezDeFi help me with this?

If you would like a refund, please contact the merchant directly.

All transactions made with cryptocurrency are direct peer-to-peer payments from the customer to the merchant. This means that once a payment is sent, there is no way for ezDeFi to reverse the transaction or reclaim funds on your behalf. As a result we are unable to resolve any payment disputes as the transactions are secured by the blockchain and are irreversible.

#### I haven’t received the item I purchased. What can I do?
Please reach out to the merchant directly regarding any issues with your order or an update on your order status.

If you believe that this merchant may be running a scam, please send an email to support@ezdefi.com  with all relevant details and a member of our security and investigations team will take a look into the account.

#### How can I track my order or get a receipt?
To help with tracking payments and status updates, ezDeFi generates an 8 character alphanumeric order code for each charge. There are two locations where this code can be found:

* In the www.ezDeFi.com URL you visit while making a payment

* On the receipt after a payment has been successfully processed

To view your receipt, please visit www.ezDeFi.com/receipts/<CODE>, where “<CODE>” is replaced with your 8 character order code.

### Payment Unsuccessful

#### Why does my receipt say that I overpaid or underpaid an order? What should I do?
ezDeFi tracks payment amounts in the cryptocurrency units. An overpayment or underpayment indicates that we have detected an amount greater or lesser than what we expected – the most common reason for this occurring is your wallet using a significantly different exchange rate than ezDeFi.

Please reach out directly to the merchant to resolve this issue – the merchant may ask you to top up the missing amount in the case of an underpayment, refund you the excess amount in the case of an overpayment, or refund you completely and ask you to complete the checkout again. We recommend that you include your receipt code to help the merchant track down your charge.

### General Questions
#### What is Nexty Platform?
Nexty is a platform based on blockchain technology to help the ecommerce startups to raise funds from the community. The startups would become part of the ecosystem of Nexty.

#### Is it possible for startups outside of e-commercial field to raise funds?
Absolutely, but startups in this field would benefit more from inside Nexty’s ecosystem, being able to take advantage of Instant Transfer and Zero Transfer Fees.

#### What are Instant Transfer and Zero Transfer Fees?
These unique technologies are exclusive to Nexty, providing ecommerce startups namely online shops or services with fast, free and stable pricing experience for users. It’s a game changer to shop and pay online without transaction fees and long waiting time for transaction confirmation.

#### What is Nexty's Unique Selling Proposition (USP) in contrast from competitors like Ethereum, Nano, Wave, Neo & etc?
Nexty can provide instant, free transfer with a stable coin price at the same time. While the competitors may offer one or two of these features, none of them can provide all of these at the same time yet. These three features are vital for ecommerce micro payment businesses for flourish, so their profit margins would not be disproportionately impacted by transaction fees.
For instance, if you buy a 10 cent item on Amazon and make payment by Bitcoin or
Ethereum, the exchange rates for BTC and ETH with USD are too high, which makes the transaction amount counter-intuitive because of too many zeroes in front of the decimal place. Moreover, the high transaction cost of the 10 cent payment via Bitcoin or Ethereum would render it uneconomically.

#### What is the total supply of Nexty's coin NTY?
The total supply is 180B NTY or 180,000,000,000 NTY where 1 pNTY = 10,000 NTY.

#### Does such a high supply devalue NTY?
Not if there’s a vibrant ecosystem that creates a strong demand for NTY. pNTY is targeted for larger transaction size, while NTY is intended for high volume micro transactions.

#### What is Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System?
Nexty introduced the Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System(DCCS) to enhance the valuation of early pNTY adopters. In addition to NTY, Nexty also minted the Nexty Foundation token NTF.

DCCS processes NTY transaction without a fee instantly. NTF will be used to verify NTY transactions and owners of NTF will receive rewards at the end of each month instead of receiving immediate transaction verification fees as commonly found in other Cryptocurrencies. Moreover, only NTF holders have privileges to mine NTY and NTF’s total supply is limited to only 10,000,000.

With Nexty ecosystem model, NTY coin will increase its value, resulting in the increase of NTF’s token value as well.

#### How to acquire the NTF coins?
It is a privilege for the first 10,000,000 pNTY owners to receive 1 NTF, in essence getting two for the price of one. But NTF can only be acquired during the ICO period; otherwise, you can acquire it on the secondary market when available later.

However, it’s unlikely because NTF owners can mine NTY coins and obtain NTY by using the Proof of Foundation algorithm. Because of such benefits, NTF holders will not sell the NTFs they own, or sell at high price.

The owners of 10,000,000 pNTY must, firstly, freeze their pNTYs to receive NTFs through the Smart Staking program.
