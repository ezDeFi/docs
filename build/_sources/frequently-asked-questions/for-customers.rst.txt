What is EzDeFi? How does it work? Where does the cryptocurrencies I’m sending go?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
EzDeFi is a platform that helps merchants anywhere in the world accept cryptocurrencies payments in a fully decentralized way.

**How this works**

* When you want to pay a merchant, we will display instructions on how to send funds directly to this merchant, and monitor the blockchain for your transaction.

* After a valid payment is detected, we will notify the merchant so they can take any necessary actions on their end.

All payments facilitated by ezDeFi are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. This means that the cryptocurrencies goes directly from your wallet to a wallet that is only accessible by the merchant. At no point in this flow does anyone except the merchant, including ezDeFi, have access to these funds.

How do I go about getting a refund? Can ezDeFi help me with this?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you would like a refund, please contact the merchant directly.

All transactions made with cryptocurrencies are direct peer-to-peer payments from the customer to the merchant. This means that once a payment is sent, there is no way for ezDeFi to reverse the transaction or reclaim funds on your behalf. As a result we are unable to resolve any payment disputes as the transactions are secured by the blockchain and are irreversible.

I haven’t received the item I purchased. What can I do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please reach out to the merchant directly regarding any issues with your order or an update on your order status.

Why does my receipt say that I overpaid or underpaid an order? What should I do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ezDeFi tracks payment amounts in the cryptocurrencies units. An overpayment or underpayment indicates that we have detected an amount greater or lesser than what we expected – the most common reason for this occurring is your wallet using a significantly different exchange rate than ezDeFi.

Please reach out directly to the merchant to resolve this issue – the merchant may ask you to top up the missing amount in the case of an underpayment, refund you the excess amount in the case of an overpayment, or refund you completely and ask you to complete the checkout again. We recommend that you include your receipt code to help the merchant track down your charge.
